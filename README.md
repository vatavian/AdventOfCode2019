# Advent of Code 2019
My solutions to the 2019 daily challenges from https://adventofcode.com/2019/about

Advent of Code is all about quickly coming up with the right answer to a complicated question.

These snippets of code are not written to be maintainable.

Performance is definitely a concern in some problems which are written so a brute-force approach will not succeed, running out of memory or taking far too long, but on most days a solution that is written quickly gets the answer faster than a solution that runs a few seconds faster but takes longer to code.

Whoever gets their answer validated the fastest wins the daily contest.
